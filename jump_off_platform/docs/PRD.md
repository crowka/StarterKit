# Cross-Platform Starter Kit: Product Requirements Document

## 1. Overview & Purpose

### Purpose
Develop a reusable, modular "starter kit" (platform) that streamlines the creation of multiple simple apps—now supporting mobile (iOS, Android), web (browsers), and desktop (Windows, macOS, Linux). This platform should handle user onboarding, design patterns, analytics, crash reporting, monetization (subscriptions, in-app purchases), notifications, and, optionally, user authentication.

### Why This Matters
By building a robust, cross-platform foundation, we significantly reduce duplication, increase code quality, and enable faster time-to-market for each new app. Extending to desktop and web expands user reach, ensures brand consistency across a wider set of devices, and provides a single codebase or framework that can be adapted to diverse platforms.

### Technology Approaches
To accommodate diverse technical stacks and leverage existing React-based systems where possible, this PRD supports two primary technology approaches:

- **React Ecosystem Approach**: React Native + Electron + React for Web
- **Flutter Approach**: Flutter for mobile, web, and desktop

## 2. Objectives & Success Criteria

### Reusability
At least 80% of the code or modules—such as navigation, common UI elements, analytics, crash reporting, user authentication, notifications, and in-app purchase handling—should be reusable across all targeted platforms (mobile, web, and desktop). This requirement applies to either the React Ecosystem or Flutter approach.

### Efficiency & Time-to-Market
Once the platform is complete, launching a new app (with minor customizations) on any of the supported platforms should take two weeks or less (excluding the time spent on app-specific feature development).

### Consistency & Maintainability
- Achieve a robust, well-documented codebase that developers can easily extend, ensuring minimal technical debt.
- Maintain a clean, consistent UI/UX to build brand recognition across mobile, desktop, and web.
- Provide platform-specific developer guidelines (e.g., packaging on macOS, building web artifacts).
- For teams using React, maintain a monorepo (or equivalent) with shared components and abstractions for React Native, Electron, and React web code.
- For teams using Flutter, maintain a single codebase with feature-first or layered architecture that cleanly separates platform specifics from business logic.

### Quality & Stability
- Maintain a crash-free session rate > 99% on each supported platform.
- Keep initial app-load times under 2 seconds for mobile, and time-to-interactive under 2 seconds for web. Desktop builds should also target quick startup times (<2 seconds on modern systems).
- Deliver all features in compliance with each relevant store or distribution channel's guidelines (e.g., Apple App Store, Google Play, Microsoft Store, web hosting requirements).

### Accessibility
- Achieve 100% compliance with WCAG 2.1 AA standards across all platforms.

### Authentication
- Complete cross-device authentication in under 5 seconds.

### Security
- Zero high or critical vulnerabilities in penetration testing.

### Performance
- 95th percentile performance metrics within defined benchmarks.

## 8. Technical Stack & Integrations

To accommodate different organizational needs or existing codebases, two main approaches are supported:

### 8.1 React Ecosystem Approach
**Front End:**
- React Native for iOS/Android mobile apps
- React for web apps
- Electron (or Tauri) for desktop packaging

**Shared Code Organization:**
- Monorepo with shared business logic, components, and state management

**Required Integrations & Services (Representative):**
- Firebase/AWS/Azure for analytics, push notifications, crash reporting, optional authentication
- react-native-iap for mobile in-app purchases
- Electron-based system integration for desktop
- Web: Payment gateways like Stripe/PayPal for subscriptions

**CI/CD Pipeline:**
- Automate builds for React Native (.apk/.aab, .ipa), Electron (.exe/.dmg/.deb), and web (bundled artifacts)
- Testing for each platform, including accessibility and security scanning

### 8.2 Flutter Approach
**Front End:**
- Flutter for iOS, Android, Web, and Desktop (Windows, macOS, Linux)

**Code Organization:**
- Single codebase with feature-first or layered architecture
- Shared business logic, minimal platform-specific code

**Required Integrations & Services (Representative):**
- Firebase/AWS/Azure for analytics, notifications, crash reporting
- flutter_inapp_purchase or official store plugins for in-app purchases
- Use relevant OS integration APIs for desktop notarization, packaging, etc.

**CI/CD Pipeline:**
- Single Flutter-based pipeline for iOS/Android, .exe/.dmg/.deb builds, and web artifacts
- Automated tests (unit, integration, E2E) for all platforms

In both approaches, ensure:
- Accessibility Testing (Axe, Lighthouse, VoiceOver, TalkBack)
- Security Scanning (OWASP ZAP, Snyk)
- Performance Monitoring (Firebase Performance, New Relic)
- Store Compliance for Apple/Google/Microsoft

## 9. Timeline & Milestones

Regardless of the chosen approach, the general timeline follows four phases:

### Phase 1 (Weeks 1–4) – Architecture & Setup
- Decide on React Ecosystem or Flutter Approach
- Create project structure and guidelines for multi-platform code organization
- Configure CI/CD for multi-platform builds (mobile, web, desktop)
- Design cross-platform authentication system
- Establish accessibility standards and testing framework

### Phase 2 (Weeks 4–8) – Core Modules
- Build out standard UI kit, theming, navigation templates for each platform
- Implement onboarding flow (screens, skip logic), analytics, crash reporting, and multi-platform push notifications
- Implement in-app purchase/subscription interfaces for mobile stores; plan for desktop/web if required
- Implement QR code-based authentication system
- Create data synchronization and migration utilities
- Implement accessibility features across all components

### Phase 3 (Weeks 8–10) – Testing & Documentation
- QA test each module thoroughly on mobile, web, and desktop
- Document platform-specific build steps (e.g., code signing, packaging for macOS/Windows, web deployment)
- Fix bugs, refine UI/UX according to each platform's best practices
- Conduct security and penetration testing
- Perform accessibility audits and remediation
- Benchmark performance across all platforms

### Phase 4 (Weeks 10–12) – Handoff & Iteration
- Final review of platform stability, performance, and compliance on all platforms
- Handoff to app-specific teams with training or documentation sessions
- Ongoing support for new feature requests or platform improvements
- Finalize App Store Optimization strategy and templates
- Document sunset and deprecation policies

**Note:** React Ecosystem projects may require additional effort integrating Electron and React Native configurations, while Flutter-based projects may have longer initial setup but a more unified codebase afterwards.

## 10. Risks, Assumptions & Dependencies

### Risks
- Additional complexity as more platforms are supported; each OS/browser may have unique quirks
- Potential library or framework limitations on certain desktop or web features
- Changing policies in app stores or distribution channels (e.g., Apple, Microsoft, web cookie policies)
