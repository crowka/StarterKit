1.  ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── OVERVIEW
    & PURPOSE ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    • Purpose\
    Develop a reusable, modular "starter kit" (platform) that
    streamlines the creation of multiple simple apps---now supporting
    mobile (iOS, Android), web (browsers), and desktop (Windows, macOS,
    Linux). This platform should handle user onboarding, design
    patterns, analytics, crash reporting, monetization (subscriptions,
    in-app purchases), notifications, and, optionally, user
    authentication.

• Why This Matters\
By building a robust, cross-platform foundation, we significantly reduce
duplication, increase code quality, and enable faster time-to-market for
each new app. Extending to desktop and web expands user reach, ensures
brand consistency across a wider set of devices, and provides a single
codebase or framework that can be adapted to diverse platforms.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── 2. OBJECTIVES
& SUCCESS CRITERIA
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── •
Reusability\
At least 80% of the code or modules---such as navigation, common UI
elements, analytics, crash reporting, user authentication,
notifications, and in-app purchase handling---should be reusable across
all targeted platforms (mobile, web, and desktop).

• Efficiency & Time-to-Market\
Once the platform is complete, launching a new app (with minor
customizations) on any of the supported platforms should take two weeks
or less (excluding the time spent on app-specific feature development).

• Consistency & Maintainability\
-- Achieve a robust, well-documented codebase that developers can easily
extend, ensuring minimal technical debt.\
-- Maintain a clean, consistent UI/UX to build brand recognition across
mobile, desktop, and web.\
-- Provide platform-specific developer guidelines (e.g., packaging on
macOS, building web artifacts).

• Quality & Stability\
-- Maintain a crash-free session rate \> 99% on each supported
platform.\
-- Keep initial app-load times under 2 seconds for mobile, and
time-to-interactive under 2 seconds for web. Desktop builds should also
target quick startup times (\<2 seconds on modern systems).\
-- Deliver all features in compliance with each relevant store or
distribution channel's guidelines (e.g., Apple App Store, Google Play,
Microsoft Store, web hosting requirements).

• Accessibility\
-- Achieve 100% compliance with WCAG 2.1 AA standards across all platforms.

• Authentication\
-- Complete cross-device authentication in under 5 seconds.

• Security\
-- Zero high or critical vulnerabilities in penetration testing.

• Performance\
-- 95th percentile performance metrics within defined benchmarks.

-- Accessibility requirements can be met without major compromises to design or functionality.

• Dependencies:\
-- Firebase (or equivalent) must remain stable and accessible for
analytics, messaging, optional user auth.\
-- Apple, Google, and Microsoft in-app purchase services for
monetization (and possible store approvals).\
-- Developer accounts for publishing in relevant stores, plus typical
web hosting or domain management for web deployment.
